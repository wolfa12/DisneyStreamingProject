# Disney Streaming Project
Mock Javascript app that resembles the Disney+ Homepage as a takehome assignment for Disney Streaming Living Room Devices.

## Tech Stack
- Node
- NPM
- Webpack
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started
The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

1. First clone the repository to your local machine - ```git clone https://github.com/wolfa12/DisneyStreamingProject.git```

2. Navigate to your project directory 

2. From your project directory, install dependecies - `npm install` 

 3. Run `npm run build`  - to build a production ready version of the app. Compiles the files and outputs them to /dist

 4. Run `npm run start` - to start a local development server. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Controls
- ARROW UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (mimics controller input)

## Future Improvements 

- Currently the banner video that is being displayed is the first title in the New to Disney+ shelf, ideally, this wouldn't be hardcoded and more dynamic to either the selected tile or a carousel of various videos from a particular shelf
- I had the idea of keeping track of the shelves via ID instead of an index, definitely a more scalable solution
- Would love to incoporate Typescript
